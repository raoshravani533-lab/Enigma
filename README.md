This project is a modern, responsive, and visually engaging landing page for Enigma – The Entrepreneurship Cell of NMIT. 
Designed with HTML and CSS, and enhanced using AOS (Animate On Scroll) animations, the website highlights Enigma’s mission, core events, and team members. 
It includes a full-screen hero section, informative about section, dynamic events display, structured team showcase, and a responsive contact form. The design emphasizes clean typography, bold colors, and a user-friendly layout. 
Ideal for showcasing Enigma's activities and encouraging student engagement, the site is optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
